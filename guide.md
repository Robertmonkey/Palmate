Palworld Complete Progression & Completion Guide
Welcome to the Palworld full completion guide. This walkthrough is organized into chapters corresponding to major progression milestones in the game. Each chapter outlines an optimal sequence of steps – presented as checkboxes – that you can follow and tick off as you play. The guide covers everything: technology research, base building, boss strategies, Pal (creature) capturing, resource farming, co-op (optional) objectives, and all DLC content. Short paragraphs and bullet points are used for clarity and readability, so you can quickly scan and follow along. Let’s dive in!
Chapter 1: Tutorial – Getting Started and First Boss Prep (Zoe & Grizzbolt)
In this chapter, you’ll establish your base, learn basic crafting, catch your first Pals, and prepare to face the first Tower Boss (Zoe and Grizzbolt).
•	[ ] Gather Basic Materials: Start by collecting Wood and Stone, the fundamental building resources in Palworld. Pick up fallen branches or chop trees to get wood, and gather rocks for stone – these materials are the foundation of nearly every tool and structure[1].
•	[ ] Craft a Workbench & Palbox: Open your Build menu and craft a Primitive Workbench (this unlocks simple item crafting)[2]. Next, unlock and build a Palbox using the Technology menu[3]. The Palbox is crucial – it stores any Pals you catch that don't fit in your active party and establishes your base area[4]. Place the Palbox on open ground to set up your first base camp[5].
•	[ ] Make Pal Spheres and Tools: Use the Workbench to craft some Pal Spheres, the devices for capturing Pals. Pal Spheres require basic materials (like Plant Fiber and Stone) – gather what you need and craft a batch of them[6]. Also craft a Stone Pickaxe as soon as possible[7], which will greatly speed up mining ore and other resources for building your base.
•	[ ] Catch Your First Pals: Equip a Pal Sphere and go find some easy targets. A great starting point is to catch 5 × Lamball (the weak sheep-like Pal) on the plains[8]. Lamballs are common and sit at the bottom of the food chain, so they’re easy to capture – plus their wool and mutton are valuable resources[9][10]. Aim the Pal Sphere and weaken a Lamball if needed, then throw the sphere to capture it. Repeat until you have a small flock. (Capturing Pals grants EXP, helping you level up as well[11].)
•	[ ] Expand Your Pal Roster: Besides Lamballs, consider catching a Chikipi (a chicken-like Pal) for a source of eggs and meat, and look for any Pal with the “Handiwork” work suitability trait. Pals with Handiwork (such as Lifmunk or Pengullet, if you come across them) will help accelerate crafting at your base[12]. Having one early means you can produce items like Pal Spheres faster and level up your base and tech more efficiently.
•	[ ] Build Basic Survival Facilities: Now that you have some Pals, set up essential base structures. Craft a Wooden Chest to store items and materials, and a Campfire for cooking food and keeping warm[13]. It’s wise to unlock a Feed Box and place it at your base, stocked with food (berries, cooked meat, etc.), so your Pals can eat and stay fed[13]. If possible, also build a small Berry Plantation farm plot near your base to grow berries for a renewable food supply[13]. Keeping yourself and your Pals fed will prevent hunger from becoming an issue.
•	[ ] Research Defense & Mobility Tech: With some gameplay under your belt, spend a Technology Point on the Energy Shield tech. Craft a shield at your workbench using Paldium ore (Paldium is an energy-rich metal found in rocks) – this shield will let you block or mitigate damage from surprise attacks[14]. Also unlock the Glider/Parachute technology as soon as it’s available[15]. Craft a Normal Parachute (glider) using your workbench; this cheap glider will allow you to safely glide down from heights, making exploration much easier and preventing fall damage[16].
•	[ ] Level Up and Upgrade Gear: Continue completing the tutorial objectives and side tasks to gain EXP. Allocate your stat points on level-up (“Enhance Stats”) to suit your playstyle[17] – for example, investing in Strength for melee or Crafting for base-building efficiency. As you hit Level 5+, unlock the Bow and Arrow tech and craft a bow for ranged offense[18]. A bow is very useful for pulling or weakening wild Pals (especially flying ones) from a distance[18]. You can also unlock basic Gun tech (pistols) around this time if you have the materials, but note that guns require ammo crafting[19] – feel free to use a bow until you have a steady ammo supply. Any armor you can craft at this stage (even a simple cloth or leather outfit) will help; unlock the Armor tech once it becomes available to you, though early-game armor is limited[20].
•	[ ] Prepare for the First Boss (Zoe & Grizzbolt): The first Tower Boss, Zoe Rayne, awaits at a tower in the grasslands. Don’t rush in immediately; it’s recommended to reach roughly Level 10 and have a team of Pals leveled and geared up before challenging her[21]. Make sure your best Pals are in your active party (you can swap Pals in and out using the Palbox). Heal them to full – Pals in the Palbox will slowly recover HP over time[3], or you can cook food to heal them. Craft a few healing items or bring plenty of cooked meals for yourself as well. Check that your weapon (bow or gun) is in good repair and you have enough arrows or bullets. Tip: Tower boss arenas have pillars and cover – use them to dodge heavy attacks, and remember each boss fight is timed to 10 minutes[22]. When you’re ready, head to Zoe’s tower (marked on the map in the starting region).
•	[ ] Defeat Zoe and Grizzbolt (Tower Boss #1): Engage Zoe (a human enemy) and her Pal Grizzbolt. Grizzbolt is an Electric-type Pal (a bear infused with lightning). Stay mobile to avoid its thunder attacks and use your shield to block any projectile or shock it emits[14]. Use your ranged weapon to chip away at Grizzbolt’s health while your Pals melee when safe. Focus on taking down Grizzbolt first – once the Pal is defeated or captured, Zoe herself is easier to handle. Keep an eye on the timer and your health; use the pillars in the arena for cover if you need to heal[22]. Don’t be discouraged if you fall in battle – any dropped items or even Pals will be relocated just outside the tower, so you can re-gear and try again[23]. Once victorious, loot the tower chest. Important: Tower chests often contain Technical Manuals – use these to gain extra Technology Points[24]! With Zoe and Grizzbolt defeated (they’re roughly level 10), you’ve cleared the first major hurdle of Palworld’s story[21].
(Co-op Notes: If you have a co-op partner, they can assist in the Zoe fight to make it easier. Co-op is not required for any boss, but teamwork can help – one player can draw aggro while the other deals damage. Be sure to enable multiplayer before entering the tower if you plan to tackle it together.)
Chapter 2: Securing the Base and Conquering Lily’s Tower (Frostbound Mountains)
With the first boss down, Palworld’s world truly opens up. In this chapter, you’ll strengthen your base automation, improve your gear, and take on Lily Everhart (Tower Boss #2) in the icy mountains. You can explore freely, but it’s wise to tackle the tower bosses in increasing level order[25].
•	[ ] Automate Resource Gathering: Now that you’ve leveled up and earned more tech points, unlock Logging Site and Stone Pit from the Technology menu (available around Tech Level 7)[26]. Build a Logging Site at your base to produce wood and a Stone Pit to produce stone automatically. Assign Pals with the Lumbering work trait to the Logging Site and Pals with Mining trait to the Stone Pit[26] – these Pals will continuously gather wood and stone for you. (For example, if you caught a Tanzee or Vixy with a Lumbering trait or a Wixen or Mau with Mining, put them to work.) This will free you from manual chopping/mining and stock your base with building materials over time.
•	[ ] Upgrade Firepower: As you venture into new areas, start crafting better weapons. If you unlocked Guns tech, try crafting a basic firearm like the Revolver or Shotgun once you have the materials (iron ingots, etc.). Guns can dispatch enemies faster than bows[19] – just remember to craft ammo. If ammo is a hassle, keep a Crossbow handy; crossbows offer high damage per shot and are easier to aim. Also consider unlocking Explosives (like grenades or bombs) if available, as these can help in tough fights or clearing groups of enemies. Having a variety of weapons (melee for close range, bow/gun for range) will prepare you for any situation.
•	[ ] Expand Pal Collection (30 Pal Goal): Continue exploring and capture a variety of Pals in each new region. Diversify your team with different elements and roles. For example, in the upcoming snow area you might find Pengullet (a penguin Pal) or Frost-type Pals that excel in cold climates. Try to capture 30 different Pal species as a long-term goal[11] – this not only broadens your capabilities but also completes a Main Mission objective, rewarding you with bonus EXP and a bundle of Pal Spheres[27]. Remember, capturing additional Pals of species you already have can still be useful (for base work or backup fighters), but focus on new entries for your Paldeck (Pal index) to hit that 30 unique mark. (Tip: Some Pals only appear at night or in specific biomes – for instance, nocturnal Pals like Daedream show up only after dark[28]. If you’re missing some creatures, try exploring at different times of day.)
•	[ ] Improve Your Base & Survival in Cold Regions: Before heading into the Frostbound Mountains (the snowy zone), craft some warm clothing and gear. Unlock the Cloth Armor or Leather Armor tech if you haven’t already, and use the Tailor’s Bench (unlock via tech) to make fur coats or other cold-resistant attire[29]. Cold environments can be dangerous, but wearing proper clothing will protect you from the chill and enemy attacks. Additionally, build a Small Shelter or place Campfires at your base and carry one when traveling – campfires can warm you up if there are temperature effects. Keep some hot meals (like cooked meat or stews) in your inventory; eating restores body heat and health. Finally, ensure your base is level 3-4 now by building various structures (each structure contributes to Base Level). A higher base level unlocks more advanced facilities and makes your Pals more efficient[30].
•	[ ] Meet the Free Pal Alliance (Optional): On your way to Lily’s tower, you might encounter outposts of the Free Pal Alliance (FPA) or Syndicate camps. These are human NPC factions – FPA are pal-loving zealots, and Syndicate/PIDF are more hostile forces. Clearing these camps can yield loot and sometimes you'll find caged Pals held by poachers. Be a hero and rescue captive Pals whenever you find them[31]! Freeing a Pal from an enemy camp will count as obtaining it (they often happily join you or can be sent to your Palbox). This is a great way to snag some rare Pals without having to weaken and capture them yourself. Plus, you might get rewards like coins or Technical Manuals from defeating human enemies.
•	[ ] Approach Lily’s Tower (Frostbound Mountains): Lily Everhart’s tower is located in a snowy forest region to the northeast, near the center of the map (around coordinates 181, 29)[32]. It’s near an FPA Tower Entrance fast-travel statue. As you near this area, you’ll face colder weather and possibly FPA followers. Make sure you and your party are around Level 25 before challenging Lily[33]. Lily’s Pal, Lyleen, is an Ice-type (it resembles a large deer or elk imbued with ice). Notably, Lyleen is Level 25 and weak against Fire-element attacks[33]. To exploit this, bring along any Fire-type Pal you’ve caught (for example, a Foxparks or Flambelle if you found one) or craft fire arrows for your bow. A Flamethrower weapon or fire bullets (if you unlocked them) would be extremely effective here.
•	[ ] Defeat Lily and Lyleen (Tower Boss #2): Start the battle with Lily Everhart. She is a fanatic who believes no one should harm Pals[34], so ironically she’ll attack you with ferocity to protect them. Lyleen will be her main offense – expect ice-based attacks, such as freezing breath or ice shard projectiles. Keep moving to avoid getting frozen or slowed. Use your fire Pals/attacks to deal extra damage to Lyleen’s ice shield[33]. While Lyleen is occupied (perhaps by your own Fire Pal), close in on Lily to stop her from buffing or healing her Pal. Coordinate your team: melee Pals can engage Lyleen up close while you take potshots at Lily, or vice versa. Remember the fight is timed (10 minutes), so focus on eliminating Lyleen first to drastically reduce the boss’s damage output. Once Lyleen falls (or is captured – yes, you have the choice to try capturing tower Pal bosses!), Lily herself can be defeated more easily. Upon victory, collect the loot from the tower chest. You’re now halfway through the base game’s tower bosses! [35][36]
(Co-op Notes: If playing with a friend, one player can bring strong Fire Pals to focus Lyleen while the other focuses on crowd control and keeping Lily busy. Co-op makes this fight more manageable, as you can divide tasks. Just be careful of friendly fire if using explosive weapons!)
Chapter 3: Advancing Technology & Axel’s Challenge (Volcanic Region)
After cooling down Lily, it’s time to heat things up. Chapter 3 focuses on powering up your technology and Pals for the tougher fights ahead. You’ll venture into the volcanic lands to take on Axel Travers (Tower Boss #3). Axel’s region is more dangerous, so preparation is key.
•	[ ] Upgrade Your Tech Tree: By now, you should have accumulated a good number of Technology Points from leveling up and exploring (don’t forget to activate Great Eagle Statue fast-travel points as you find them – each activation grants tech points, and makes travel easier[37]). Use these points to unlock higher-tier crafting stations and items. Key upgrades around mid-game include the High-Quality Workbench (for advanced weapons and tools), the Repair Bench (to fix your weapons so they don’t break mid-fight)[38], and improved Crafting Stations like the Forge or Factory. Unlock Weapons Level 2 to craft stronger melee weapons (e.g., steel swords, spears) and Armor Level 2 for metal armor sets – you’ll need the extra protection against stronger enemies now[20]. If you see “Ancient Technology” nodes, note that those require special Ancient Tech Points (we’ll handle that soon). Prioritize anything that boosts your survivability and damage output, as the next boss is significantly tougher.
•	[ ] Harness Ancient Technology (Optional but Recommended): Ancient Technology is a separate tech tree unlocked by Ancient Tech Points. You can earn these by delving into dungeons scattered around the world (for example, there’s likely a dungeon in the Snowy Mountains or other regions that you can access now). At the deepest part of each dungeon, look for a treasure chest containing an Ancient Technical Manual – using one gives you an Ancient Tech Point[39][40]. Consider doing a dungeon run now to start unlocking useful ancient tech. High-value ancient techs include the Egg Incubator (allows you to hatch Pal Eggs) and the Pal Essence Condenser (combine duplicate Pals to create stronger versions)[41]. For instance, unlock the Egg Incubator and set it up at your base to hatch any Pal Eggs you’ve found[42]. Hatching eggs can yield rare Pals you might not easily find in the wild, so it’s a great way to bolster your team. Another handy gadget is the Grappling Gun – unlock that to swing around and reach high places easily[43], which is especially useful in the mountainous and volcanic terrains coming up.
•	[ ] Enhance Base Operations: Your base should be growing into a proper headquarters now. Unlock and build a Ranch if you haven’t (to automatically raise livestock Pals like Lamballs, Chikapi, etc., for a steady supply of wool, eggs, and meat)[3]. Also consider building a Greenhouse or Crop Farm for consistent crop production (if those techs are available – some updates add advanced farming). Mid-game updates to Palworld introduced a Monitoring Stand which lets you fine-tune what jobs Pals perform at base[44]. If you have this, build one so you can assign certain Pals exclusively to certain tasks (e.g., dedicate one Pal purely to mining, another purely to logging) for efficiency. Finally, as your base grows, defend it: hostile NPCs or wild Alphas might raid your base. Install an Alarm Bell[45] so you can quickly toggle your Pals to combat mode when under attack. You could also place some turrets or traps (if unlocked in tech) at choke points around your base. A well-defended, automated base will keep supplying you while you’re off adventuring.
•	[ ] Power Up Your Pals: The upcoming fights demand stronger Pals. Take some time to level up your main Pal team. You gain Pal EXP by fighting and capturing Pals, but you can also boost them via the Training Dummy structure (if unlocked, Pals can spar with it to gain experience)[46]. If you’ve unlocked Breeding, you might breed two strong Pals to get a new Pal with potentially better stats or a rare passive skill. Also, check if you found any Pal Candy or stat-boosting fruits – use those to increase your Pals’ stats or happiness. Aim to have a balanced party: at least one heavy hitter, one tanky Pal to draw aggro, and one with a useful support skill (healing or buff). Many players like to include a Mountable Pal (like a fast ground mount or a glider Pal) in the party for quick travel; for example, Melpaca or Rushoar can be saddled if you unlocked their harness[47]. Being able to ride or fly with a Pal makes exploring the volcanic area much easier.
•	[ ] Enter the Volcanic Region (Mount Obsidian): Axel’s domain is the Tower of the Eternal Pyre, located in a volcanic area towards the southwest of the map (near Mount Obsidian, coordinates roughly -587, -517)[36]. The environment here is hot and filled with lava pools. Equip some fire-resistant gear if available, or bring along a Pal with the Cooling work trait to help mitigate heat (some Pals can have an aura that cools you – check your Pal traits). Gather Sulfur, Coal, Iron, and other ores in this region; they’re used for gunpowder and higher-tier metal alloys. Watch out for aggressive fire-type Pals and the hostile PIDF forces that patrol near the tower. Make use of your Grappling Gun or glider to traverse lava and cliffs safely. By the time you reach Axel’s tower entrance, you and your Pals should be around Level 40. This tower is near a teleport point called Eternal Pyre Tower Entrance, which you should activate for convenience.
•	[ ] Prepare for Axel and Orserk: Axel Travers is a formidable opponent – a hulking warrior obsessed with strength[48]. His Pal Orserk is a massive lava dragon (or beast) that deals heavy fire damage. According to reports, Orserk is Level 40 and is weak to Ice and Ground elements[49]. Plan your team accordingly: bring an Ice-type Pal or two (for example, an evolved form of an ice Pal you caught earlier) or a Ground-type Pal that can nullify electric and fire effects. If you have weapons with elemental damage, equip an Ice Grenade Launcher or craft Water ammo for your guns to exploit Orserk’s weakness. It’s also wise to carry a Water Bucket or two – sounds silly, but tossing water (if the game allows via water containers) on lava or on a burning Pal can sometimes douse flames. Make sure to have plenty of healing items and some antidotes; volcanic bosses sometimes inflict burn or other status effects. Check that your armor is upgraded (iron or better) because Axel hits hard. Save your game (if not on hardcore mode) and steel yourself for a tough fight.
•	[ ] Defeat Axel and Orserk (Tower Boss #3): Engage Axel at the Tower of the Eternal Pyre. Axel himself will likely charge at you with melee attacks – don’t go toe-to-toe with him unless you’re very tanky. Kite him around the arena while focusing on Orserk, the giant Pal. Orserk will unleash fire AoEs (Area of Effect attacks) and possibly lava pools on the ground. Keep moving and use the terrain for cover. Utilize your Ice/Ground attacks liberally: for example, have a Pal cast a slowing ice breath or use a ground-pound ability to stagger Orserk[49]. Every bit of elemental damage helps. When Orserk roars and powers up, back off and go on the defensive (block with your Energy Shield or dodge behind a pillar). Coordinate your Pals: a water-element Pal can douse Orserk’s flames, and a flying Pal can distract it from above. Once Orserk’s health is down, concentrate fire on Axel. Axel has a one-track mind for victory – he’ll fight until the bitter end seeking a strong opponent. Punish his slow but strong attacks by dodging then counterattacking. After a grueling battle, you will bring down Axel and his Pal. Loot the tower chest for high-tier rewards (often High Grade Technical Manuals which give multiple tech points[50], and possibly unique schematics). Congrats – Axel’s defeat proves you’re the strongest in the region, and you’re now ready for the final stretch of the main story! [35][51]
(Co-op Notes: In co-op, one player can try to ride a flying Pal to draw Orserk’s aggro from above while the other attacks from the ground. Just be cautious – Orserk can still knock flyers out of the sky. Communicate with your partner to tag-team Axel; perhaps alternate who Axel targets by taking turns attacking him, so he’s constantly chasing one or the other.)
Chapter 4: Desert Dominion – Toppling Marcus (PIDF Commander)
With three towers down, the next target is Commander Marcus Dryden (Tower Boss #4), who rules the desert. Chapter 4 will guide you through optimizing your equipment and base defenses and then taking on Marcus in the Desiccated Dunes.
•	[ ] Maximize Equipment Upgrades: At this point, aim to craft the best weapons and armor available to you. If you picked up any special schematics (perhaps from Axel’s tower or side quests), use them now. For example, Axel’s defeat might have yielded a Rocket Launcher Schematic or Semi-Auto Shotgun Schematic[52] – these high-power weapons can be game-changers. Craft them if you can, along with plenty of ammo. Upgrade your melee weapon to a Steel or Titanium tier sword/axe, and your ranged weapon to an Assault Rifle or Sniper Rifle if available. Also, unlock Armor Tier 3 (if the tech tree allows by your level) and craft heavy armor (like Kevlar vest or metal armor pieces) to bolster your defense[53]. Going into the desert, you might face human enemies with guns, so higher defense and maybe a Ballistic Shield would help. Don’t forget to carry a Repair Kit or two (small tech point cost to unlock) so you can fix your weapons in the field if they wear down[54].
•	[ ] Fortify Base Defenses: As you progress, enemy raids can become more dangerous. Take some time now to fortify your base. Build walls or fences around your base perimeter (stone walls or even electric fences if unlocked). Set up a couple of Auto-Turrets at key entry points if you have the schematics (turrets might require power – you can use a Pal with the Generating Electricity trait on a treadmill or a generator structure to supply power). If turret tech is not unlocked, laying down Spike Traps or Landmines (crafted via explosives tech) around your base can deter wandering hostile Pals or Syndicate soldiers. Ensure your Alarm Bell is in place to rally your Pals on defense mode when needed[45]. You can assign a few combat-capable Pals to stay at base as guards (set their behavior to defensive via the Pal Management menu or Monitoring Stand). Having a secure base means you can venture into the desert without worrying about coming home to a ruin.
•	[ ] Into the Desiccated Dunes: Head toward the Desiccated Dunes, the arid desert region on the eastern side of the main island. The desert is Marcus’s territory – under the guise of the PIDF (Palworld Integrated Defense Force), he runs illicit operations here[55]. Expect to encounter PIDF soldiers armed with firearms and possibly drug labs or contraband caches guarded by them (as lore suggests Marcus is funding himself via drug trafficking[55]). Move carefully from cover to cover, and use long-range weapons to pick off human enemies before they see you. The desert heat isn’t as much a gameplay issue as the cold was, but do bring water and watch your Stamina (endurance can drop faster if there is a heat mechanic). Look for Oases or cacti that can provide water if you get parched. As you explore, gather Desert Ore like aluminum or crystals – new crafting materials for high-tech gear. You might also find Alpha Pals roaming here (e.g., an Alpha variant of a Scorpion Pal); only engage them if you’re confident or save them for later, as they can be tough. Keep leveling up; by the time you approach Marcus’s tower, try to be at Level 45 or above to match his Pal’s level[56]. Activate the PIDF Tower Entrance teleport statue near the tower for a quick return point[56].
•	[ ] Target Marcus’s Weakness: Marcus Dryden awaits at a desert stronghold (coordinates ~556, 335)[56]. His partner Pal Faleris is a fearsome creature (possibly a sand worm or dragon) of Level 45, and it has a glaring weakness: Faleris is weak against Water-element Pals[56]. Leverage this! Bring along one or two Pals with Water-based attacks – for example, a Surfent (a water whale/shark Pal) or a Penguin-type Pal with water gun attacks. If you lack a water Pal, craft a weapon that can deal water damage; sometimes there are water grenades or you can attach an elemental mod to a gun to shoot water bullets. Also, consider using the environment: the desert might have water barrels or pipes (especially if near an oasis or settlement) – exploding a water tower near Faleris could drench and weaken it (situational, but keep an eye out). Ensure you have your Energy Shield equipped to block any projectiles Marcus’s troops might fire during the fight. Lastly, stock some sandstalker boots or an accessory that prevents slowing – deserts sometimes have quicksand or abilities that impede movement, so any gear that boosts mobility on sand is helpful.
•	[ ] Confront Marcus and Faleris (Tower Boss #4): Initiate the fight with Marcus. Marcus is a military man; expect him to use firearms and call reinforcements. He might throw grenades or deploy mines, so watch your step. Meanwhile, Faleris – his Pal which could be a giant scorpion or sand dragon – will likely burrow and strike from below, or spit sand projectiles. Focus on Faleris first: use your Water Pals to douse it, which can significantly increase damage dealt to it[56]. If Faleris goes underground, keep moving to avoid its eruption point (you’ll see rumbling where it might emerge). Throw water grenades or have your Pal use a torrent ability when it surfaces. Once Faleris is weakened or defeated, turn your attention to Marcus. Marcus may take cover and shoot; use pillars or walls as cover as you advance. Toss a flashbang or smoke grenade (if you have them) to flush him out. Melee players can rush him with a shield raised to stagger him. Ranged players should snipe when he pops out to attack. With his Pal gone, Marcus’s corruption comes to an end when you defeat him. Enjoy the spoils in the tower chest – likely high-end tech manuals and perhaps unique Desert region loot. Now only one regular tower remains in the base game storyline![57]
(Co-op Notes: In the Marcus fight, one player can engage the mob of PIDF soldiers that might join the fray while the other focuses on Faleris. Communication is key – if one player gets tagged by a sniper (indicated by a laser sight possibly), call it out and have a Pal or partner interrupt that enemy. Two players can also coordinate to keep Faleris wet: e.g., alternate water attacks so it’s consistently debuffed.)
Chapter 5: Climax of the Main Story – Victor’s Lab (Astral Mountains)
With Marcus defeated, the core island’s factions are handled. Chapter 5 leads you to the culmination of Palworld’s main Early Access storyline: Victor Ashford (Tower Boss #5) in the Astral Mountains. Victor’s tower will test all your skills and your team’s strength. We’ll finalize our tech, then take him on.
•	[ ] Final Tech Unlocks: By now you are likely around Level 50, which is near the Early Access level cap[58]. Ensure you’ve unlocked every useful technology available at this stage. Use any remaining Technical Manuals from your inventory to squeeze out last few tech points. Important late-game techs include the Hyper Glider (a much faster glider for travel)[59] if you can craft it, and advanced facilities like Production Line Factory or Assembly Line II to mass-produce items[59]. If you haven’t yet, unlock the Small Feed Bag (Ancient Tech) which gives you an auto-feeding slot in your inventory (so your character and Pals automatically consume food when hungry)[60] – this quality-of-life upgrade keeps you focused during long fights without worrying about manual eating. Another handy one is the Hip Lantern (Ancient Tech) for hands-free lighting in dark areas[60] (useful if Victor’s tower or caves are dim). Essentially, fill out as much of your tech tree as possible. There’s no need to save points now, so get those last weapon upgrades, base structures, and gadgets. Palworld’s level cap and tech list will expand in future updates, but you should aim to “100%” your current tech options at this stage[58].
•	[ ] Polish Your Base & Gear: This is a good time for final housekeeping. Raise your Base Level to 7, which is currently the maximum[30]. You might achieve this simply by building every kind of structure and decoration you can. Build luxury items (even if decorative) like lights, furniture, etc., since they contribute to base level. A Level 7 base doesn’t just earn an achievement; it also ensures you’ve got the maximum slots for Pals and the highest efficiency. Double-check your gear: repair everything to 100% durability, stock your Feed Box with plenty of food (so your resting Pals recover and any new eggs can hatch with fed babies), and perhaps cook some buff dishes. Certain recipes (if you’ve found them) can temporarily increase your attack, defense, or elemental resistance. For example, a spicy stew might boost warmth and attack, while a cool parfait could boost water resistance – use whatever edge you can get. Also, organize your inventory: carry ammo for each weapon, healing potions, status cure items, and maybe a teleport item if the game has one (some games let you craft a return whistle or teleportation stone to quickly exit a dungeon; if Palworld has an equivalent, bring it in case you need to bail from Victor’s tower to regroup).
•	[ ] Journey to the Astral Mountains: Head to the far northwestern reaches of the island – the Astral Mountains. This high-altitude, snowy region is where Victor’s secret laboratory lies[61]. As you approach, you may notice strange structures or mutated Pals, hinting at Victor’s experiments in genetic engineering[61]. Fight or avoid any experimental creatures (they might be very strong “chimera” Pals) as you see fit. The path up the mountain could be tricky: use your Hyper Glider or Grappling Gun to navigate cliffs efficiently[43]. Look out for crevasses in the ice – falling in could be fatal, but your parachute/glider will help if you slip. Eventually, you’ll reach Victor’s tower entrance (coordinates ~-146, 448)[62] at a facility labeled the PAL Genetic Research Unit. Activate the fast travel statue here. Ensure one more time that your party is healed and equipped. Victor Ashford is the mastermind behind all the unethical experiments on Pals[63] – this is the big showdown. His Pal, Shadowbeak, is a dark avian Pal engineered through vile experiments. Shadowbeak is Level 50 and notably weak to Dragon-element attacks[64]. If you have any Dragon-type Pals (like Vanwyrm or Helzephyr), put them in your team now to exploit that weakness. If not, see if you can craft Dragon-element ammunition or bombs (some games allow elemental infusions – e.g., “Dragonfire rounds”). Also, consider using a Legendary Pal if you’ve caught one; by this point you may have encountered Legendary Pals (boss-level wild Pals) and they can turn the tide in your favor.
•	[ ] Defeat Victor and Shadowbeak (Tower Boss #5): Enter the final tower arena to face Victor. Victor Ashford is a cunning scientist; he may use gadgets or even try to turn the environment against you. Shadowbeak, his monstrous bird-like Pal, will attack fiercely from the air. Immediately have your ranged Pals (or yourself, with a gun) target Shadowbeak to ground it – use Dragon-element strikes which Shadowbeak is vulnerable to[64]. For example, if you have a Dragontype Pal like a Dracoth, use its breath attack or dragon claw skill on Shadowbeak for massive damage. Shadowbeak might summon smaller minions or emit dark energy blasts; dodge those and keep up the pressure. Meanwhile, keep an eye on Victor: he might toss out grenades or even inject himself with a serum to power up (lorewise, he’s desperate and might use his own experimental enhancements). If Victor’s using ranged attacks, deploy a fast Pal to harass him so he can’t snipe you comfortably. The fight is chaotic, but focus on one target at a time. Typically, taking down Shadowbeak first is wise – once the terrifying bird is down, the biggest damage dealer is gone[65]. Then you can corner Victor. Use any crowd-control abilities you have (stuns, freezes) to keep Victor from running or using devices. Given this is the climax, don’t hold back: use your strongest ammo, your rare grenades, and your Pal skills liberally. Eventually, you’ll defeat Victor Ashford and put an end to his inhumane research[66][63]. This is effectively the “end” of the main storyline that’s currently available. Grab the loot (which should be plentiful high-end materials and maybe a unique Pal egg or schematic as a reward). Congratulations – you’ve completed the core Palworld story arc by conquering all five original tower bosses[67]!
(Co-op Notes: This final battle is a great moment for co-op play. With two players, you can assign roles – for instance, one focuses on Shadowbeak with a sniper rifle or homing attacks, while the other player keeps Victor occupied. Be mindful of each other’s positions; Shadowbeak’s area attacks or Victor’s gadgets could accidentally hit both of you if you cluster. Revive mechanics (if any) are easier with a partner, so use that safety net if someone goes down.)
Chapter 6: Sakurajima Island – The Moonflower Tower (Saya & Selyne)
Palworld’s adventure continues beyond the initial five bosses, thanks to updates and DLC. Chapter 6 covers the Sakurajima Island content (from the Sakurajima Summer update), where a new boss Saya Kurosaki awaits in the Moonflower Tower. This is an optional chapter if you have the DLC/updates (which we assume you do, since we’re covering all DLC).
•	[ ] Travel to Sakurajima: After dealing with Victor, you can access Sakurajima Island, a separate landmass introduced in a major update[68]. To get there, use the world map or a boat at the harbor (depending on how the game implements travel – Sakurajima might be reachable via a portal or a zone transition from the main island’s coast). Once on Sakurajima, register the Moonflower Tower Entrance teleport statue for ease of return. Sakurajima is a beautiful island with falling cherry blossoms, but don’t let the serene look fool you – new challenges abound. Explore a bit to gear up: this island features new Pals (some with a Terraria collaboration theme, if the event is active, as hinted by “Tides of Terraria” content)[69]. Catch some of these new Pals if you like; some might be very powerful or fill missing roles in your Paldex. Notably, Easygoing Yakumo is a Pal mentioned in context of Sakurajima – a gentle Pal under the cherry blossoms[70] – perhaps you’ll meet one. Gather new materials unique to Sakurajima, like Sakura petals or special ores, which can craft unique weapons or decorations. Make sure you’re around Level 55 or higher, as the enemies here scale up to meet the new boss’s difficulty[71].
•	[ ] Confront the Moonflower Guardian: The tower on Sakurajima is Moonflower Tower, and its guardian is Saya Kurosaki, accompanied by her Pal Selyne. The lore: Saya stood watch over this timeless island and, after a fateful encounter with a Pal called the Blade of the Crescent Moon, she’s ready to face challengers[72]. In practical terms, Selyne is a Level 55 Pal with (presumably) Moon or Light elemental attacks, and is weak to Dragon element[71]. Good news – if you built a team to beat Victor, you likely have strong Dragon-element capabilities, which will also help here. Prepare accordingly: keep those Dragon Pals or weapons handy. Additionally, consider that Selyne might use light-based or celestial attacks (just based on naming), so having some Dark-element defense or a Dark-type Pal could be useful as a counter. Sakurajima’s boss might also introduce status effects like moonlight charm or sleep – bring along some remedies (antidotes, energy drinks, etc. that cure status). One more thing: check out the Sakurajima Update gear. The update might have added cool items like a Moon Blade or Starfall grenade. If you have access to these, equip them to play into the moon theme (for fun and effectiveness).
•	[ ] Defeat Saya and Selyne (Sakurajima Tower Boss): Enter the Moonflower Tower and face Saya & Selyne. The battle takes place under a gorgeous night sky with cherry blossoms – stay focused! Selyne, Saya’s Pal, could be a graceful yet deadly creature (maybe a moonlit unicorn or a celestial fox). It will likely deal hybrid damage (magic-like attacks). Stick to the plan: use Dragon-element attacks to exploit Selyne’s weakness[73]. If you have a Vanwyrm or Helzephyr from earlier, they can shine in this fight. Be aggressive with Selyne; you don’t want it staying alive too long possibly buffing under moonlight. Saya herself might wield a katana or bow (just thematic guesses) – if she’s melee, kite her; if she’s ranged, zigzag to avoid projectiles while siccing a fast Pal on her. The arena might be smaller than previous ones, so spatial awareness is key; don’t back into the edges where you might get cornered by AoEs. Once Selyne goes down, double-team Saya. At this point in the game, you have an arsenal of powerful options: feel free to unleash raid-level weapons (like if you acquired any special items from raid bosses – more on those soon – now’s a good time to use them). After an intense fight, Saya will fall in defeat. Collect your well-earned rewards from the Moonflower Tower chest. This victory symbolizes breaking the stillness of Sakurajima’s eternal night[72], and you’ve added another legendary Pal (Selyne, if captured or logged) to your accomplishments.
(Co-op Notes: Co-op is strongly recommended for these higher-level DLC bosses if you find them challenging. Two players can coordinate Dragon attacks on Selyne for a quick takedown. You can also run distraction plays – one player can draw Selyne’s aggro by being a nuisance Pal rider (flying around it), while the other focuses on Saya or vice versa. Just watch out for friendly fire with those late-game explosive weapons.)
Chapter 7: Feybreak Island – The Final Tower (Bjorn & Bastigor)
The last major content currently available is the Feybreak Island and its tower boss, Bjorn Seligsson and Bastigor, introduced in the Feybreak update (late 2024). This island and boss are designed as endgame content – Level 60+ – so prepare for the toughest fight in Palworld so far.
•	[ ] Explore Feybreak Island: Travel to Feybreak, a new island region added in the update[68]. Feybreak is unlocked once you’ve cleared the previous towers, or via a story prompt after Sakurajima. It might be accessible by a portal or from a dock similar to Sakurajima. Feybreak is an eerie, perhaps cursed land, once struck by catastrophe[74]. As you explore, you’ll notice the environment is different – there may be areas with a dark curse or new mechanics (the update added things like Predator Pals and new game modes[75]). One notable mechanic from Feybreak update: you can send Pals to explore dungeons independently[76]. Try this out – assign a high-level Pal to do an auto-exploration run in a dungeon while you do other tasks. It’s a way to gather loot in parallel (though keep an eye on them, they could need rescue if they faint). Gather new Feybreak resources such as Fey Crystals, new herbs, etc., which can craft top-tier healing items and weapons. Ensure your character level is at the cap (likely 60 now) and your Pals are similarly maxed out or close. This is the final lap, so you want your very best pals at peak performance.
•	[ ] Gear Up for Level 60 Combat: Use Feybreak’s downtime to get the absolute best gear. If new weapons are introduced (e.g., rumors of Legendary tier weapons in this update), pursue those. For instance, the update trailer might have shown something like a Laser Rifle or Spirit Katana – obtain and equip any ultimate weapons you can[77]. Also, craft the highest tier of ammo (e.g., Meteorite Bullets were mentioned in tech lists[78]). Meteorite Bullets or similar will pack a punch needed for a level 60 boss. Potion-wise, brew the best potions: max healing potions, buff potions (attack up, defense up), and maybe an elemental resistance potion if Bastigor has a particular element. Speaking of which, Bastigor (Bjorn’s Pal) is Level 60 and weak to Fire-element attacks[79]. So plan to bring the heat – literally. Equip fire-element weapons or have a strong Fire Pal (like Blazagon or Ifrit-type Pal if any exist). Even your trusty Lamballs from the start, if somehow raised to max and evolved, could serve by providing wool for Fire-resistant armor or as sacrificial decoys (just kidding… mostly). Seriously though, consider evolving or fusing Pals for optimal traits now – for example, combining Pals in the Pal Essence Condenser to create higher-ranked versions with better stats[41]. If you have Legendary Pals (like those hinted at by the NPC in Feybreak who talks about “legendary Pals in each corner of the world”[80]), assemble them into an all-star team. You’ve come a long way from catching Lamballs; now you might command dragons, phoenixes, and giants.
•	[ ] Confront Bjorn in Feybreak: Make your way to the tower at the heart of Feybreak where Bjorn Seligsson stands guard (coordinates ~-1294, -1669)[81]. The setting is grim – Bjorn has been protecting this cursed land’s people, waiting for a “day of reckoning”[74]. It seems that day has come, and it’s you. Bastigor, Bjorn’s Pal, is a hulking beast (perhaps a golem or giant stag) imbued with all the burdens of the land. It’s Level 60 and weak to Fire[82], which is unique because many would expect water or light, but no – fire will be your ally here. Hopefully you kept a powerful Fire Pal or two; if not, one strategy is to use the Awakening Starfruits (there’s a reward giving an Awakening Starfruit ☆1[83] if you did Wildlife Sanctuary missions) to boost a Pal’s element effectiveness. Use one on any Pal with a fire move to elevate its power. Ensure you and your Pals are well-fed and at full health and stamina before initiating the fight. Double-check the 10-minute timer still applies – it likely does – so everything you do should be focused on DPS (damage per second) and survivability.
•	[ ] Defeat Bjorn and Bastigor (Final Tower Boss): The fight with Bjorn & Bastigor is the ultimate challenge. Bastigor, Bjorn’s Pal, likely embodies the “burdens” or curses – expect heavy-hitting attacks that could one-shot lesser Pals. Keep your team spread out to avoid multi-target smashes. Immediately deploy your Fire attacks on Bastigor to exploit its elemental weakness[82]. If you have a legendary Fire Pal (e.g., Blazamut Ryu – a raid boss Pal if you obtained it – or a high-level Pyrodragon), set it on Bastigor and let loose. Use any debuffs you have: an item or Pal ability that lowers enemy defense will help chunk down Bastigor’s massive HP. Bjorn himself is a veteran fighter; he might have high defense or even a shield that you must break through. Bastigor might also shield Bjorn or regenerate his health if not dealt with, so prioritize taking Bastigor out. Utilize hit-and-run tactics: have a fast mount Pal you can hop on to quickly evade if Bastigor charges or Bjorn winds up a big attack. The environment in Feybreak might have lingering effects (like patches of cursed ground); try to lure the boss away from those if they harm you, or into them if they harm him. When Bastigor finally falls, only Bjorn remains. At this point, Bjorn may unleash some final desperation move – be ready for a flurry of attacks or an “enrage” mode. Stay calm, use your shield, dodge roll, and let your Pals strike when openings appear. Little by little, whittle down Bjorn’s health and claim victory over Palworld’s toughest boss to date. This battle is meant to be undertaken last, after defeating all other bosses, as even the game’s guidance suggests[84]. Upon winning, bask in the achievement: you’ve essentially 100% completed the current Palworld storyline! Open the final chest for rich rewards, possibly including 5-star Legendary gear or a Mythical Pal Egg. Well done, Champion of Palworld!
(Co-op Notes: Two-player strategy for Bjorn can make the fight notably easier. One strategy is “tank and spank”: have one player with a super-tanky Pal (and heavy armor) draw Bjorn and Bastigor’s attention, essentially tanking hits with shield and evasions, while the second player unloads continuous damage (preferably fire-based) from behind. Swap roles if the tank needs a breather to heal. Coordinate use of items – e.g., Player A drops a healing AoE item while Player B covers them with suppressive fire. In co-op, you can also employ complex tactics like cornering Bastigor between two sets of attacks or juggling aggro, which is difficult solo. Teamwork will trivialize even the hardest foe if done right!)
Chapter 8: Post-Game – Optional Objectives and Mastery
Congratulations on finishing all main story and DLC tower bosses! Palworld doesn’t end here – there are plenty of optional objectives and endgame activities to keep you busy. This final chapter lists the completionist tasks and fun challenges you can pursue to truly experience everything Palworld has to offer.
•	[ ] Complete the Paldeck (Catch ‘Em All): Set a new goal to catch every Pal species in Palworld. There are many unique Pals across different biomes, including some that only spawn under certain conditions. Use your Paldeck (Pal encyclopedia) to track which ones you’re missing[85]. Explore every nook of each island – for example, some Pals only appear in the Wildlife Sanctuaries around the map’s edges (these are restricted zones housing rare Pals)[86]. Also remember the tip from earlier: some Pals only show up at night or during specific weather[28]. For instance, a ghostly Pal might roam a graveyard only at midnight, or a certain fish Pal might appear only when it’s raining. You may need to do some hunting and perhaps use Effigies or Lures (if the game has Pal attractor items) to draw out elusive creatures. The ultimate prize for catching all Pals is the personal satisfaction (and bragging rights), but the game may also reward you – check if there’s a completion reward when the Paldeck is full.
•	[ ] Collect All Journal Logs (Lore Hunt): During your travels, you might have noticed floating bluish tablets on pedestals – these are Journal Logs[87]. Each log contains lore and story background about the world of Palworld and its inhabitants. Now that you’re powerful and can roam freely, go back and collect all these logs. They are often hidden in out-of-the-way locations: deep caves, high cliffs, ruins, etc. Use the Palworld Interactive Map (if available in-game or via the community) to find known log locations[88]. Reading all logs will give you a deeper appreciation of the story (for example, insights into characters like Zoe or Victor beyond what you saw in-game). If you’re a completionist, this is a must-do task.
•	[ ] Breed the Ultimate Pals: Engage with the Pal Breeding system to create super-powered Pals. Build a Breeding Farm (you likely unlocked this facility around mid-game) and start pairing Pals to pass down desirable traits[89]. Through breeding, you can aim to combine the best Passive Skills and elemental attributes onto one Pal. For example, you might breed a Pal that naturally has a high Attack stat with another Pal that has a rare passive like “Bottomless Stomach” (so it doesn’t need as much feeding)[90] or “Regeneration” for health regen. The result could be an offspring Pal with both qualities – high attack and self-healing. Breeding also lets you obtain Pals that are otherwise very hard to find; sometimes eggs can hatch into Legendary Pals with a bit of luck. Spend time experimenting with combinations (the community might have shared some breeding recipes for special variants). The Tides of Terraria update even added new breeding combos, so there may be surprises in store[69]. Ultimately, you could breed a team of “perfect” Pals with max IVs (individual values) using the Pal IV Stat Checker and breeding calculator tools[91]. This is the route to becoming a PvP or raid powerhouse.
•	[ ] Tackle Raid Bosses (Co-Op Challenges): Palworld features special endgame Raid Bosses – like Xenolord, Blazamut Ryu, and Bellanoir – which are designed to be fought by multiple players in co-op[92][93]. If you haven’t tried these yet, gather some friends (or join an online server) and attempt them. For example, Xenolord is a Level 60 Alpha raid boss you can summon at your base via a special totem[94]. It has an Ultra form and summons minions during the fight, and you must defeat it within a 10-minute timer for rewards[95][96]. These raids drop exclusive loot like unique Pal eggs, legendary weapons, or cosmetic items. They are arguably the toughest fights in the game (even tougher than Bjorn, due to the coordinated chaos), but also the most exciting multiplayer content. Check out the raid-specific guides for team composition tips[97] – typically you want a mix of damage dealers, a tank, and perhaps one Pal dedicated to buffing or healing the team. Even if you play solo, you can attempt raids by yourself (it’s very challenging but possible if extremely optimized). Completing raids on the highest difficulty yields titles and rare schematics that truly round out your collection.
•	[ ] Trade and Evolve via Multiplayer: Now that you’re an expert Pal tamer, consider engaging in some Pal trading with other players. There might be Pals you couldn’t get due to version differences or sheer rarity – other players might have spares. Palworld supports trading via the Multiplayer Trading Board or direct trades in co-op sessions[31]. For instance, if you still need a Pal from a limited-time event (say a Terraria crossover Pal), check the community or your friends – someone might trade it for one of your rare Pals. Additionally, some Pals might have evolutions or forms that require special methods (perhaps trading itself triggers evolution, akin to classic monster-collecting games). Explore these mechanics. You can also visit the Black Market Marketeer NPC in-game, who sometimes sells rare Pals for a high price[31]. Now that you’re rich with loot and gold coins (you should be, after all those bosses!), you could buy a missing Pal directly. Trading and buying are optional, but they’re great for filling gaps in your Paldeck or obtaining multiples of high-value Pals (like getting a second of a legendary Pal to breed with your first one, etc.).
•	[ ] Decorate and Optimize Your Base: With no looming threats, you can indulge in creativity. Use the wealth of decorative items unlocked (posters, statues, furniture, etc.) to make your base a home. Create themed rooms: a Pal Nursery with all your Incubators and Pal beds, a Workshop area with all crafting stations neatly laid out (maybe with signs labeling each section), a Trophy Room where you display boss rewards or rare items (like those Boss Hats you earn from Hard Mode boss fights[98]). You can even build separate bases on each island if you’re up for it – one in Sakurajima under the cherry blossoms, one in Feybreak’s wilderness, etc. Now that you have the Monitoring Stand and Pal management fully under control, you could design an automated farm that’s a marvel of efficiency: Pals feeding crops, harvesting, depositing into chests, all without your input. The sandbox aspect of Palworld really shines here; feel free to experiment with contraptions (like setting up conveyor belts if those exist, or using Pals with Transporting skill to move goods around) to create a self-sustaining ecosystem.
•	[ ] Engage in PvP or Challenges: If you’re into competition, test your mettle against other players in PvP battles (if the game mode is available). There is a PvP tier list for Pals[99] – perhaps build a team according to the meta and see how you fare in friendly duels. Alternatively, challenge yourself with personal goals: speedrun the game (how fast can you defeat all tower bosses?), attempt a hardcore Nuzlocke-style run (where any Pal that faints is considered “dead” and must be released), or try out the new Hard Mode for Tower Bosses introduced in updates (bosses drop cosmetic boss hats when defeated in Hard Mode within 10 minutes[98]). These self-imposed challenges can extend the game’s life and provide fresh experiences even after completing everything.
•	[ ] Stay Tuned for Future Updates: Finally, remember that Palworld is still in development (full version 1.0 is planned for 2026)[100]. Follow the official Pocketpair announcements for new content[101]. The roadmap hints at new islands, possibly a proper story campaign, and even a legendary World Tree area in the future[101]. Keep an eye out for major patches – when a new Palworld update drops, you’ll be ready to jump back in as an experienced Pal trainer. When that time comes, you can bet there will be new Pals to catch, new bosses to battle, and new technology to uncover. Until then, enjoy the vast sandbox you’ve mastered, help out other new players with your expertise, and have fun in Palworld!
