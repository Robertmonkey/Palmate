# Palworld — Complete Normal Route (All DLC)  
**Co‑op ready (optional steps), checkbox-driven, and optimized for a 2nd‑grader‑friendly playthrough**

> **How to use this in your app (Codex):**
>
> - Treat any **[[Pal]]**, **[[Item]]**, **[[Tech]]**, or **[[Location]]** in double brackets as a link target to your existing database pages.  
> - Each bullet with `- [ ]` is a **checkbox step**. Your app can persist completion state so you and your son can pick up where you left off.  
> - Steps marked **(Optional)** are non-blocking. Steps marked **(Co‑op Optional)** are designed for two players and should appear as separate, non-required checkboxes.  
> - Keep the **“Chapter Checklist”** visible and collapse the **“Why / Tips”** section by default for a simpler kid UI.
> - Need extra context?  Pair this route with the granular catalogue in **`palworld_complete_guide.md`** or the progression overview in **`palworld_purposeful_guides.md`**.

## Assumptions & Goal
- Difficulty: **Normal**  
- Mode: **Solo or 2‑player co‑op** (co‑op steps are optional)  
- Content: **Base game + Sakurajima + Feybreak DLCs**  
- Target: **Beat all towers in order** and finish with a fun, automated base network, strong teams for each element, and simple steps kids can follow.

---

## Global Conventions (Quick Legend)
- `- [ ]` = Do this once and check it off.
- **(Optional)** = Nice to have; skip if your kid is ready to move on.
- **(Co‑op Optional)** = Second player task to make things faster, never required.
- **Stockpile Goal** = Gather these before the next milestone to keep momentum.
- **Spend Tech Points** = Unlock now so recipes are ready when needed.
- **Catch Goals (x10)** = Catch duplicates up to 10 of a species to level faster (catch bonus).

---

## High-Level Route (for the grown-up’s quick view)
1) **Start & set up Base #1** → early gear, **[[Normal Parachute]]**, **[[Common Shield]]**, **[[Small Feed Bag]]**, catch early worker pals.  
2) **First tower: Zoe & [[Grizzbolt]] (Lv 10)** → get Ancient Tech; unlock **[[Grappling Gun]]** and **[[Egg Incubator]]** if not already.  
3) **Unlock flying** with **[[Nitewing]]** (Lv 15 saddle) → move ore operations to **Base #2** near rich nodes; start farming & breeding (Cake).  
4) **Second tower: Lily & [[Lyleen]] (Lv 25)** → unlock/explore **[[Ore Mining Site]]**; begin automation.  
5) **Tech push to Lv 35** → build **[[Sphere Assembly Line II]]** + craft **[[Ultra Sphere]]**; prep **Ground/Ice** team.  
6) **Third tower: Axel & [[Orserk]] (Lv 40)** → heat prep; clear volcano.  
7) **Fourth tower: Marcus & [[Faleris]] (Lv 45)** → Water team and firearms.  
8) **Fifth tower: Victor & [[Shadowbeak]] (Lv 50)** → Dragon team, **[[Electric Furnace]]**, **[[Assault Rifle]]**.

- Include a **“Co‑op” toggle** that reveals the **(Co‑op Optional)** steps as extra checkboxes.  
- Keep steps bite‑sized and celebratory — e.g., confetti when a tower is cleared!
