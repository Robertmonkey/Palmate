# Palworld Purposeful Progression Guides (2025)

These guides are designed to replace the generic tips from earlier versions with **purpose‑driven, progression‑oriented routes**.  Each section lays out *what* you need to do, *why* it matters, and *where* to go (with coordinates) so you can chart a clear path from your first base to the end‑game.  After each objective you'll find a suggested **Next step** to help you chain tasks together naturally.

## Early Game (Levels 1–10)

### 1. Establish Your Starter Base
*Purpose:* Claiming a base near plentiful resources lets you craft early tools and begin automation.

1. **Choose a site:** Set up your first Palbox at the **Plateau of Beginnings**.  Two recommended coordinates are **North 233, −488** and **South 264, −548**.  These spots provide access to wood, stone, Paldium fragments and a nearby dungeon【715083186508802†L126-L133】.
2. **Gather resources:** Collect **50 wood** and **30 stone** from nearby trees and boulders.  This amount is enough to build a campfire, a workbench and several Pal Spheres.
3. **Build the workbench and Palbox:** Use the build menu to craft a **Primitive Workbench** (10 wood, 5 stone) and a **Palbox** (8 wood, 8 stone, 3 Paldium fragments).  Place them near the Palbox to minimize walking.
4. **Craft basic tools:** Create a stone axe and pickaxe at the workbench and use them to harvest wood and stone more efficiently.  Save extra wood for Pal Spheres and campfires.
5. **Unlock key tech:** Spend early technology points on the Palbox, Primitive Furnace, and Pal Sphere upgrades.  Ancient tech items (like the Grappling Gun) require ancient points from bosses【440006372449663†L112-L117】.

**Next step:** With your base established, craft 5–10 Pal Spheres and head out to capture your first Pals.

### 2. Capture Your First Working Pals
*Purpose:* Early Pals automate gathering and provide combat backup.  Focus on Pals with useful work suitabilities such as Kindling and Lumbering.

1. **Lamball and Tanzee:** These common Pals spawn near the Plateau.  Lamball supplies wool for early armour; Tanzee offers Lumbering for wood harvesting.  Weaken them gently and throw Pal Spheres until you succeed【17376928547404†L117-L130】.
2. **Capture Foxparks for Kindling:** Travel east to **(171, −473)**, near a river and waterfall, to find Fire‑type **Foxparks**【225842761179926†L61-L78】.  Bring a water‑type Pal like Pengullet.  Weaken Foxparks with water attacks and capture it with Pal Spheres【225842761179926†L82-L88】.  Assign it to kindling tasks at your campfire or furnace; it also drops Flame Organs and Leather【225842761179926†L98-L106】.
3. **Assign Pals to work:** Use the Palbox to designate Lamball for Wool production, Tanzee for Lumbering, and Foxparks for Kindling.  This early automation speeds up resource collection.

**Next step:** Begin gathering rare materials like Leather and Paldium to unlock mounts and advanced crafting.

### 3. Harvest Leather and Paldium
*Purpose:* Leather is required for saddles and armour, while Paldium fragments are needed to craft Pal Spheres and early electronics.

1. **Leather hunting:** Venture to areas north of the Plateau and hunt **Rushoars** and **Fuacks** for Leather.  Each Leather costs 150 Gold if purchased from merchants, but farming it yourself saves money.
2. **Mine Paldium:** Search riverbeds and glowing blue rocks near your base to mine **Paldium fragments**【354485449518951†L225-L231】.  Gather at least 15 fragments to craft multiple Pal Spheres and prepare for mount harnesses.

**Next step:** With Leather and Paldium in hand, unlock your first mount.

### 4. Unlock and Ride Eikthyrdeer
*Purpose:* A ground mount speeds up exploration and provides a double jump for reaching high ledges.

1. **Capture Eikthyrdeer Terra:** Travel to the **No. 1 Wildlife Sanctuary** at **(95, −729)**【376067536546693†L142-L145】.  Avoid PIDF guards or fight them if necessary【376067536546693†L146-L146】.  Bring high‑tier Pal Spheres and weaken the ground‑type Pal before capturing.
2. **Unlock the saddle:** Reach **Level 12**, then spend two technology points to unlock the **Eikthyrdeer Saddle**【960495633276618†L192-L203】.  Gather **5 Leather, 20 Fiber, 10 Ingots, 3 Horns, and 15 Paldium fragments** to craft the saddle【960495633276618†L179-L191】.
3. **Craft and equip:** Use the Pal Gear Workbench to craft the saddle.  Equip it in the Pal Gear menu and mount Eikthyrdeer to enjoy faster travel and increased logging efficiency【960495633276618†L206-L213】.

**Next step:** Use your mount to explore mid‑game regions like **Cinnamoth Forest** (−77, −310) for sulfur and ore【715083186508802†L142-L148】.

## Early‑Mid Game (Levels 10–25)

### 5. Build an Intermediate Base and Stockpile Resources
*Purpose:* Relocating to richer areas allows you to farm ore, sulfur, and coal needed for guns and bombs.

1. **Cinnamoth Forest base:** Move your Palbox to **(−77, −310)** in Cinnamoth Forest.  This region offers abundant **Ore nodes** and nearby **Sulfur** deposits【715083186508802†L142-L148】.  Construct furnaces and chests to refine ore and store gunpowder ingredients.
2. **Sealed Realm of the Guardian:** For coal farming, set up a satellite base near **(180, −39)**; this area has plentiful coal and is ideal for powering furnaces【715083186508802†L150-L155】.
3. **Upgrade base level:** Build additional structures (e.g., Primitive Furnace, Ranch, Crusher) and assign Pals to them.  Completing more structures raises your base level, allowing you to employ more Pals simultaneously.

**Next step:** With resource production automated, prepare to challenge your first tower boss.

### 6. Confront the First Tower Boss (Zoe & Grizzbolt)
*Purpose:* Defeating tower bosses grants **Ancient Technology Points** needed for devices like the Grappling Gun and Electric Incubator.

1. **Gather a balanced team:** Assemble Pals with **Ground‑type** moves (e.g., Rushoar or Grizzbolt) to counter the boss’s **Electric** element【243842513808367†L60-L67】.  Reach at least Level 20 and craft firearms or crossbows.
2. **Reach Rayne Syndicate Tower:** Travel west of your starting area to **(110, −431)**【243842513808367†L60-L67】.  Activate the fast travel point outside for quick access.
3. **Prep and fight:** Equip healing items and ranged weapons.  During the fight, focus on dodging Grizzbolt’s electric attacks and exploit its weakness with Ground moves.  You must deal ~30k damage within 10 minutes.  Upon victory you receive several Ancient Technology Points.

**Next step:** Spend your Ancient Technology Points on the **Grappling Gun** or **Egg Incubator**, then plan your next tower assault.

### 7. Expand Merchant Interactions
*Purpose:* Merchants sell unique items like Skill Fruits, high‑tier Pal Spheres and schematics.  Visiting all settlements unlocks convenient trade routes.

1. **Small Settlement:** Head northwest of the Plateau to **(73, −485)**【751885980579990†L272-L276】.  Activate the fast travel marker and interact with the **Pal Merchant** and **Wandering Merchant** to buy Pal Spheres, medicine and skill fruits.
2. **Duneshelter:** Travel to the Dessicated Desert at **(356, 346)**.  Bring heat protection for daytime and cold protection for night【751885980579990†L281-L286】.  Trade with merchants for weapons and ammo; be aware of NPCs glitching underground (reload the game to fix). 
3. **Fisherman’s Point:** Visit **(−479, −745)** near Mount Obsidian【751885980579990†L298-L303】.  Buy seafood, fish Pals and other supplies.  Watch out for volcanic hazards if you venture inland.
4. **Wandering merchant camps:** Look for merchants at **Marsh Island (432, −272)**, **Sea Breeze Archipelago (−189, −601)** and **Forgotten Island (−397, 17)**【751885980579990†L315-L337】.  Note the items each merchant specializes in (red vs. green)【751885980579990†L358-L379】.

**Next step:** Save up gold by selling extra Pals or resources to merchants; you’ll need funds for legendary spheres later.

## Mid‑Game (Levels 25–40)

### 8. Unlock Advanced Technology and Weapons
*Purpose:* Mid‑game tech like firearms, gliders and lockpicking tools enhances survival and exploration.

1. **Grappling Gun:** After defeating your first tower, spend Ancient Tech Points to unlock the **Grappling Gun**.  Gather **2 Ancient Technology Parts**, **15 Paldium Fragments**, **30 Ingots** and **30 Fiber** (check patch notes for exact numbers) to craft it.  Use the grappling hook to climb cliffs and escape danger quickly.
2. **Firearms:** Unlock **Musket** and **Handgun** technologies.  Craft **Gunpowder** by combining **Sulfur** and **Charcoal** in the Furnace, then craft bullets at the Weapon Workbench.
3. **Lockpicking Tools v1–v3:** Craft lockpicks at the Workbench using **Ingot, Paldium** and **Fiber**.  Use them to open locked chests found in dungeons and supply drops.  Higher tiers open more complex locks.

**Next step:** Continue leveling and collecting sulfur, coal and oil to prepare for later raids and bosses.

### 9. Challenge Subsequent Towers
*Purpose:* Each tower defeat yields more Ancient Tech Points and unlocks tougher content.

1. **Free Pal Alliance Tower (Lily & Lyleen):** Travel to **(184, 27)** in the north【243842513808367†L60-L67】.  Bring **Fire‑type** Pals to counter their Grass element.  Defeat them within the time limit to earn ancient points.
2. **Eternal Pyre Tower (Axel & Orserk):** Head to **(−584, −514)** in the southwestern volcanic region【243842513808367†L60-L67】.  Use **Ice** and **Ground** attacks against their Dragon/Electric elements.  Equip heat‑resistant armour.
3. **Tower of the PIDF (Marcus & Faleris):** Located at **(558, 338)**【243842513808367†L60-L67】, this fight requires **Water‑type** Pals to exploit Faleris’ Fire weakness.  Craft extra cooling gear for the desert climate.
4. **Pal Genetic Research Unit (Victor & Shadowbeak):** The final tower at **(−150, 440)** pits you against Dark/Dragon types【243842513808367†L60-L67】.  Bring **Dragon‑ and Ice‑type** Pals and the best weapons you have.

**Next step:** After clearing all towers, you’ll have ample Ancient Tech Points.  Invest in Electric Incubators, advanced saddles and end‑game weapons.

## Late Game (Levels 40–50+)

### 10. Capture Legendary Pals
*Purpose:* Legendary Pals offer unparalleled mobility and combat prowess.  Capturing them marks your mastery of Palworld.

1. **Jetragon (Flying Mount):** Travel to **(−795, −323)** on the Volcanic Island.  Equip heat‑resistant armour and bring strong **Ice‑type** Pals【64861741309788†L139-L145】【64861741309788†L159-L165】.  Stock **10–15 Legendary Pal Spheres**【64861741309788†L172-L175】.  Weaken Jetragon, dodge its attacks and capture it.  Equip its missile launcher to rain rockets on enemies.  
2. **Frostallion (Ice Mount):** Seek out Frostallion in the snowy regions (coordinate details vary).  Use **Fire‑type** attacks and heavy armour.  The mount provides a fast ground‑and‑air hybrid ride and high damage.  
3. **Other legendaries:** Hunt **Necromus, Paladius** and **Jormuntide Ignis** in high‑level regions; each requires specialised Pals and legendary spheres.  Consult updated patch notes for spawn coordinates and strategies.

**Next step:** With multiple legendary mounts, you can tackle world events, raids and co‑op challenges with ease.

### 11. Complete Raids and Seasonal Events
*Purpose:* Raids like **Xenolord**, **Blazamut Ryu** and **Bellanoir** offer unique loot, while seasonal events introduce crossover bosses.

1. **Gather a raid party:** Recruit friends or high‑level NPC Pals.  Raid bosses have huge health pools and unique mechanics; coordinate elemental roles (DPS, tank, healer).
2. **Stock supplies:** Craft hundreds of bullets, rockets, potions and food.  Bring backup weapons and armour sets tailored to the raid’s element.
3. **Learn mechanics:** Pay attention to raid cues (e.g., telegraphed AoE attacks) and prioritise adds (minions) when they spawn.  Use terrain to your advantage.
4. **Claim rewards:** Defeating a raid boss yields powerful gear, rare Pals and cosmetic items.  Repeat raids for better rolls.

**Next step:** Participate in limited‑time events (e.g., **Terraria** crossover) to obtain unique Pals and skins.

## Conclusion

These progression guides replace the previous generic tips with structured, goal‑oriented routes that carry you from your first day in Palworld to the end‑game.  Each objective has a clear purpose, detailed steps, and suggested follow‑ups.  By following these routes—capturing key Pals, optimising your bases, unlocking technology, defeating tower bosses and claiming legendary mounts—you’ll be well on your way to mastering Palworld.

These missions offer powerful rewards and should be woven into your overall progression.  For instance, tackle **Hungry for Recruits** and **Pal’s Blessing** while still based in Windswept Hills, but wait until you’ve unlocked heat and cold resistant gear before attempting **Sparkly and Smooth** or **Dungeon Hunt**.  The **Legend** and **Motivational Leader** missions provide Applied Techniques that dramatically improve your Pals’ work efficiency, making them valuable late‑game objectives.

## Technology Unlock Guides

The **Technology** tab in Palworld lets you spend Technology Points and Ancient Technology Points to unlock new workstations, weapons, armour and **Pal Gear**.  Below is an overview of key technologies organised by level bracket.  For items tied to a specific Pal (like saddles or harnesses), you must **capture the corresponding Pal** before you can craft or equip their gear.  Capture guides are provided where needed.
