'''Production Assembly Line''' is a [[production]] [[structure]].

An upgrade to the [[High Quality Workbench]], the Production Assembly Line is capable of producing even higher level [[Items]] and [[Equipment]], at a greater speed thanks to the ability for multiple [[Pals]] to work together. It is not capable of crafting [[Spheres]] or [[Weapons]] that the High Quality Workbench cannot, however.

[[Pals]] with the {{I|Handiwork}} suitability can craft items that are queued here. Up to 3 Pals may work at this station at the same time.

The [[Production Assembly Line II]] is the direct upgrade to this crafting station.

== Acquisition ==
It's a tier 28 [[technology]] item and requires 3 points to unlock.
