}}{{paldeck|Surprisingly, it is unrelated to Pengullet. Ever wanting attention, this Pal will strut its stuff for any onlookers. }}
'''Penking''' (Japanese: '''キャプペン''' ''Cappen'') is a {{i|Water}} / {{i|Ice}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

== Appearance ==
Penking is a penguin-like Pal with a relatively large build. Like the smaller [https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Pengullet Pengullet], its body is primarily blue, with shades of both darker and lighter blues. It has white on its face and neck collar. The tassels over its shoulders are an amber color. Its beak has closer resemblance to various species of water fowl, platypus and Fuack than it does penguins or Pengullets. The top of its head takes the shape of an old captain's hat with a red adornment on top.

== Behavior and habitat ==
Can be found in Wildlife Sanctuary #1, also show as an Alpha Pal in the Sealed Realm of the Frozen Wings.
