'''Fuack''' (Japanese: '''カモノスケ''' ''Kamonosuke'') is a {{i|Water}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

== Paldeck Entry==
{{Paldeck|Using its own body water, this Pal can create waves anywhere. It body surfs when in a hurry, but the resulting speed often ends in a fatal collision.}}

==Biology==
===Appearance===
Fuack appears like a blue, bipedal platypus with a yellow duck bill and two strange tufts sticking out on its head resembling pigtails. It has a white frill around its neck, split up into several bead-like segments. It also has a beaver or platypus tail, which is a slightly different shade of blue than the rest of its body. 

===Behavior===
This Pal can be found roaming around bodies of water and inland, it may run away from the player. Like most Pals, wild Fuack will retaliate when attacked.

==Trivia== 
*Fuack's name may come from the words ''fowl ''and ''quack''. It also may come from "thwack," referencing its ability (might also be an innuendo).
*Its Japanese name may come from 鴨 ''kamo'' (duck) and -之介 ''nosuke,'' the latter being a way to end masculine names popularized in the Sengoku and Edo periods, this practice is usually considered quaint in the present. Additionally, it could be based on the term 助 ''suke'' (helper or assistant).
