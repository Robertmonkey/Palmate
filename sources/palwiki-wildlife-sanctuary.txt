The Wildlife Sanctuaries are 3 islands on the peripheral of the [[Palpagos Islands]]. Each of the 3 islands contain pals that are only available on the sanctuary.

==Environment==
The '''Wildlife Sanctuaries''' are strange, possibly artificially-created islands that serve as unique spawn locations for wild versions of [[Alpha Pals]] and Pal subspecies. 

Visiting a Wildlife Sanctuary is considered [[Trespassing]] and will spawn varying levels of [[PIDF|PIDF Officers]]. While on one of these islands, the offending player's screen will display a warning that "Criminal Activity is Underway", and being spotted will warrant a level 1 [[Trespassing]] charge from the [[PIDF]].

==Locations==
There are currently 3 Wildlife Sanctuaries:
*[[No. 1 Wildlife Sanctuary]]
*[[No. 2 Wildlife Sanctuary]]
*[[No. 3 Wildlife Sanctuary]]

==Local Pals==
{{PAGENAME}} is home to several pals which are not currently found elsewhere in the wild, like [[Eikthyrdeer Terra]] or [[Orserk]], or are only found as Alpha pals, such as [[Azurobe]] or [[Warsect]]. Pals in Wildlife Sanctuaries vary in levels, from around level 20-25 in No. 1 Wildlife Sanctuary all the way to level 50 in No. 2 and No. 3 Wildlife Sanctuary, but tend to be consistent within sanctuaries, ie there won't be level 50s in No. 1 Wildlife Sanctuary.

==Unique Incidents==
There are several incidents unique to the {{PAGENAME}}. A list is available on the [[Random Spawns]] page.

==Trivia==
* The PIDF that spawn at the island give much less XP than they should for their level. This is most likely intentional to prevent players from getting a trespassing charge and perpetually level grinding.
* Visiting a Wildlife Sanctuary while on a mount, specifically a flying one, will bypass the [[Trespassing]] warning so long as the player does not get off the mount.
** As of [[0.1.5.0]], this bug has now been fixed.
