How To Get Refined Ingots In Palworld — SegmentNext (retrieved 2025-10-20)
Refined Ingots require both Ore and Coal alongside an Improved Furnace; you unlock both recipes from the Technology menu after reaching level 34.
Building an Improved Furnace costs 100 Stones, 30 Cement, and 15 Flame Organs, so stock the materials before heading to the ridge.
SegmentNext recommends assigning high-Kindling pals like Jormuntide Ignis and notes each refined ingot consumes Ore ×2 and Coal ×2.
The guide points to coordinates (191, -36) because the cliff hosts both ore and coal nodes, suggesting three Digtoises, three Tombats, and hauler pals to automate the loop.
