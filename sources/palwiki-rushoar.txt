}}{{paldeck|Being an extremely aggressive Pal, it often picks fights before gauging its opponent's strength. Though small, its powerful charge can even send boulders flying. }}
'''Rushoar''' (Japanese: '''ノイボウ''' ''Noibou'') is a {{i|Ground}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

== Appearance ==
Rushoar is a medium-sized, stylized boar with long black legs and a short, black tail. It has large blue grumpy eyes, a long snout and huge tusks. Rushoar has three vertical white stripes on his back and a very short black mohawk haircut. It has small hips and wide shoulders. Curiously, Rushoar doesn't appear to have any ears at all.

== Behavior and habitat ==
Rushoar appears in small groups, usually of 2-3 individuals, and attacks the player on sight. It appears to be carnivorous and will eat the corpses of fallen Pals.  

Rushoar's signature dash attack is much slower than that of [https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Melpaca Melpaca] or [https://palworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Direhowl Direhowl], but it also sends enemies flying and briefly stuns them. As of early access, Rushoar's dash has the tendency to knock poachers into level geometry.

== Utility ==
Rushoar can mine rocks at the base. However, [[Cattiva]] has the same level in mining and eats much less food.

You can use Rushoar's charge skill to mine rocks and ore quite efficiently.
