'''Wumpo Botan''' (Japanese: '''トロピティ''' ''Tropiti'') is the {{i|Grass}} [[Elements|element]] [[Breeding|variation]] of [[Wumpo]].

== Appearance ==
Wumpo Botan is a large rotund Pal with dark and light green fur over top of black skin. It also has a flower on its head. These Pals also keep an unknown plant in their mouth at seemingly all times.

== Behavior and habitat ==
These Pals can be found in [[No. 2 Wildlife Sanctuary]] and as [[Alpha Pals]] on the [[Eastern Wild Island]].

[[File:Wumpo_Botan_Night_Habitat.webp|thumb|Nightime Wumpo Botan Spawns]]

== Utility ==
Wumpo Botan's [[Partner Skill]], Guardian of the Grassy Fields, augments the player's [[carrying capacity]] by 120 at rank 1. Note that this requires a [[Wumpo Botan Saddle]] to become active; if the player does not have one in their Key Items, this additional carrying capacity will not take effect. This saddle also permits Wumpo Botan to be [[Mounts|ridden]].

Wumpo Botan also has the highest [[Transporting]] [[Work Suitability|suitability]] in the game, at 4. This is shared with [[Wumpo]]. Despite being able to move massive quantities of items at a time, Wumpo Botan moves slowly when transporting items, meaning that other Pals may be better choices when selecting a Pal to transport items into chests around the base.

Wumpo Botan loses Wumpo's level 2 [[Cooling]] suitability, replacing it with level 1 [[Planting]].

== History ==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.2 to 0.24.
* [[0.1.2.0]]
** Introduced.

== Trivia ==
* Wumpo is the only Grass element subspecies whose element isn’t from its regular counterpart. As a result, it uniquely has the “Botan” suffix, derived from “botanical”.
* The Japanese name might be from “tropical” and “Yeti.”
