Nox is a nocturnal Dark-type Pal whose possible drops include Leather and Small Pal Souls. According to its behavior notes, Nox only spawns at night (lingering briefly after dawn) and may flee unless provoked. Like other nocturnal pals, it keeps working through the night if assigned at base and does not need beds.
