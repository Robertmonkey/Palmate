'''Lamball''' (Japanese: '''モコロン''' ''Mokoron'') is a {{i|Neutral}}-[[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

== Characteristics ==

=== Appearance ===
Lamball is a small, sheep-like bipedal Pal with a spherical body mostly covered with white wool. It also possesses a pair of small yellow horns and two crystals on its chest.

=== Behavior and Habitat ===
Lamball has a neutral temperament, only attacking if attacked first or if it sees a player attacking another Lamball.

Lamball is commonly found in low-level areas such as the [[Windswept Hills]], the [[Sea Breeze Archipelago]], and [[Forgotten Island]]. It usually spawns in groups of 2 to 4 individuals.[[File:Lamball_Day_Habitat.webp|thumb|Daytime Lamball Spawns]]
[[File:Lamball_Night_Habitat.webp|thumb|Nightime Lamball Spawns]]

=== Utility ===
Lamball is a good early base Pal as it possesses both Lvl 1 [[Handiwork]] and Lvl 1 [[Transporting]], allowing it to craft items and build structures as well as transport items to chests. It can also be assigned to a [[Ranch]], where it will slowly produce {{i|Wool}} over time.

While Lamball isn't the best combat Pal, its Fluffy Shield [[Partner Skills|Partner Skill]] could potentially be a life saver in tough situations for lower-leveled players.

== Notes ==

* If a Lamball is constantly attacked, it will not be able to retaliate in any way.

== Trivia ==
* {{PAGENAME}} was also featured in the [https://youtu.be/lBeJ9IrAKnw Cooking with Pals - Lamb BBQ] animation.
* [[Chikipi|Chikipi's]] Palpedia entry mentions Lamball as being one of the weakest Pals alongside it.
** Despite this, Lamball is slightly stronger than [[Chikipi]] and on par with [[Cattiva]].
* Lamball's English name might come from "lamb" (a young sheep) and "ball".
* Lamball's Japanese name might come from モコモコ (mokomoko) for "fluffiness" and either 転んだ (koronda) for “to tumble” or コロコロ (korokoro) for "rolling".
* Lamball is #007 in Paldeck on PocketPair [https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1677286340231327744 X].

== History ==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.4 to 0.48.
* [[0.1.2.0]] 
** Introduced.
