}}{{paldeck|Its hard tail does not deteriorate even when cut off. Some believed these severed tails to be good luck but, for the innumerable Mau who where poached as a result, they where anything but.}}
'''Mau''' (Japanese: '''ニャオテト''' ''Nyaotet'') is a {{i|Dark}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]]. It has an {{i|Ice}} [[Elements|element]] [[Breeding|variation]], [[Mau Cryst]].

== Appearance ==
Mau is a small cat-like Pal with ebony fur and gold markings across its body. It has a gold ornament at the tip of its tail, and it has a gold collar around its neck. It has two gold bands around each of its ears and legs.

== Behavior and habitat ==
It can be found within dungeons in the [[Windswept Hills]] or captured in the camps of a [[Enemies|faction]].


== Utility ==
Mau digs up [[Gold Coins]] while assigned to a [[Ranch]].

== History ==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.4 to 0.48.
* [[0.1.2.0]]
** Introduced.

== Variant(s) ==
* [[Mau Cryst]]

== Trivia ==
* This Pal was named by the community during a [[Name This Pal]] event.
* Mau’s name and Egyptian theme are inspired by the Egyptian Mau cat breed. In the game files, Mau is called “Bastet.” Its tail tip, shaped like a sistrum, reinforces this connection, as the Egyptian cat deity often holds one.
* The Japanese name might be from ニャオ “Nyao” (the sound a cat) and “Bastet.”
* This Pal is #041 in Paldeck on PocketPair [https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1720410507713085442 X].
