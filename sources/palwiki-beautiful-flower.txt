=== Tips and Advice ===

* If choosing to farm the flowers via defeating Grass-element Pals, it's recommended to bring a Blazehowl or Katress Ignis along to defeat them, as their unique partner skills make Grass-aligned Pals drop more items. 
** On a similar note, the best Pal to bring to farm Ribbuny would be Katress or Blazehowl Noct; the best Pal to bring along to farm Wumpo would be Faleris, and the best Pal to bring along to farm Lyleen Noct would be Elphidran.
