}}{{paldeck|Milk pours from this Pal like water from an open faucet, regardless of its gender. It's truly a mystery of life, although this mystery may be better left unsolved.}}
'''Mozzarina''' (Japanese: '''ミルカルビ''' ''Milkalbi'') is a {{i|Neutral}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

==Appearance==
Mozzarina is a black-and-white cow-like Pal, whose torso and head are two round balls, with four stumpy legs as well as a pair of pink udders barely visible underneath. Its face has two closed eyes, two slightly curved tan horns, and a curved smile with two visible fangs.

==Behavior and habitat==
It wont attack unless attacked.

[[File:Mozzarina_Night_Habitat.webp|thumb|Nightime Mozzarina Spawns]]

== Utility ==
Mozzarina's [[Partner Skill]], Milk Maker, causes it to produce [[Milk]] when assigned to a [[Ranch]].

Mozzarina's mediocre combat capabilities are almost always ignored in favor of its sole work suitability, [[Farming]]. While assigned to a ranch, Mozzarina will produce Milk, which can be used at a [[Campfire]] to make [[Hot Milk]] or at a [[Cooking Pot]] to produce a variety of high-SAN foods such as [[Pancake|Pancakes]].

==History==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.2 to 0.24.
* [[0.1.2.0]]
** Introduced.

==Trivia==
* Their name may come from the word ''mozzarella''.
* Its Japanese name may come from ''milk'' and ''kalbi'' (Korean grilled ribs).
* Mozzarina does not have a gender ratio of 1-to-1 Male to Female.  Mozzarina has a 20% chance to spawn as a male and an 80% chance to spawn as a female; this is in contrast with most other Pals, which have an equal chance to spawn with either gender. Other Pals with uneven gender ratios include [[Beegarde]], [[Elizabee]], [[Dazzi]], [[Lovander]], [[Kingpaca]], [[Kingpaca Cryst]], [[Warsect]], [[Lyleen]], and [[Lyleen Noct]].
