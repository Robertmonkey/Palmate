The '''Tomato Plantation''' is a [[Building]] which can produce [[Tomato]]es. This can be done manually by the player, or through the use of [[Pals]] with the proper work suitabilities ([[Planting]], [[Watering]], and [[Gathering]]).

Note that [[Tomato Seeds]] are not required to produce Tomatoes, only to construct the Plantation itself.

==Acquisition==
It's a tier 21 [[technology]] item and requires 2 points to unlock.
