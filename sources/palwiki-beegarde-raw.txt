}}{{paldeck|A servant that pledges loyalty to [[Elizabee]]. Any that cause harm to the queen are immediately expelled from the hive. It will gladly give its life to protect its queen.}}
'''Beegarde''' (Japanese: '''ビーナイト''' ''Beeknight)'' is a {{i|Grass}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

==Appearance==
Beegarde is a warrior inspired by bees. It has white wings, a black cape, and limbs with black and white stripes. On its head there is a purple tip.
==Behavior and habitat==
It can be found in a group and will attack if it notice the players. It sometimes may use its explosion skill, which cause a lot of damage.

[[File:Beegarde_Night_Habitat.webp|thumb|Nightime Beegarde Spawns]]

==Utility==
{{PAGENAME}} is able to Craft, Build, Lumber, and passively produce Honey while assigned to the ranch.

In the party, Beegarde buffs the stats of [[Elizabee]].

==History==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.2 to 0.24.
* [[0.1.2.0]]
** Introduced.

==Trivia==
* Its Japanese name may come from ''Bee'' and ''Knight''.
* Beegarde does not have a gender ratio of 1-to-1 Male to Female. Beegarde has a 10% chance to spawn as a male and a 90% chance to spawn as a female; this is in contrast with most other Pals, which have an equal chance to spawn with either gender. Other Pals with uneven gender ratios include [[Mozzarina]], [[Elizabee]], [[Dazzi]], [[Lovander]], [[Kingpaca]], [[Kingpaca Cryst]], [[Warsect]], [[Lyleen]], and [[Lyleen Noct]].
** This is justified as almost all bees in real life are females.
