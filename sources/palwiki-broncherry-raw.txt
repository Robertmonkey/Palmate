== Utility ==
Broncherry has a base Stamina of 100 and a Mount Speed of 500, making it the slowest Mount in the game, on par with [[Sweepa]] and [[Broncherry Aqua]]. 

Its [[Partner Skill]], Overaffectionate, offers two benefits. The passive benefit, which requires the Broncherry Saddle, increases the player’s Carrying capacity by +100/+110/+120/+130/+140, depending on the Partner Skill Level. This bonus is cumulative with other Pals in the party, providing a significant boost.

This passive bonus is the second highest in the game, matched by [[Broncherry Aqua]], [[Kingpaca]], and [[Kingpaca Cryst]], and only surpassed by [[Wumpo]] and [[Wumpo Botan]].

== History ==
* [[0.2.4.0]]
** Increased the Alpha Received Damage Rate from 0.2 to 0.24.
* [[0.1.2.0]]
** Introduced.

== Variant(s) ==
* [[Broncherry Aqua]]

== Trivia ==
* Broncherry’s name might be a blend of “brontosaurus” and “cherry.” Interestingly, it also resembles the French phrase “Mon Chéri” (my dear), which is used to show affection, fitting the love theme of this Pal.
* The Japanese name might originate from ラブラブ “raburabu” (a Wasei-eigo term meaning “love-love”), which describes being affectionate or infatuated. It likely also includes the suffix “-odon,” commonly found in the scientific names of large animals.
* Despite its English name, Broncherry more closely resembles an ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amargasaurus Amargasaurus]'', namely due to the petal-like structures its head and neck being similar to the spines seen on the skeleton.
*This Pal is #048 in Paldeck  on PocketPair [https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1738167508719271951 X].
