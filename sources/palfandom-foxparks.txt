==Trivia==
* This Pal may take inspiration from Japanese folklore about foxes gaining supernatural abilities as they age, including the ability to wield fire. As such, its Japanese name is a combination of the Japanese term used for foxes in general and 火 ''bi'' (fire)
* The name Foxparks may come from the words ''fox ''and ''sparks''.
* Foxparks was featured in Paldeck No.001 on PocketPair [https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1669676196957659137 X] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0Ds7F9If6o youtube channel].
