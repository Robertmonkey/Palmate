Daedream is a Dark-type Pal that drops Small Pal Souls and Venom Glands. Its behavior notes that the species is nocturnal, spawning only at night or inside dungeons before fading with sunrise. Daedreams remain docile until attacked and continue working overnight if assigned at base, never requiring beds.
