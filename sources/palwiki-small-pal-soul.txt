Small Pal Souls are most commonly found lying on the ground randomly throughout the map. They can also be obtained from crafting by using the Crusher. Some Pals (Daedream, Nox, Cawgnito, Maraith, Felbat, Tombat) can drop Small Pal Souls when captured or defeated. The material is used at Statues of Power to upgrade Pal statistics.
