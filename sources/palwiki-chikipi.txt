'''Chikipi''' (Japanese: '''タマコッコ''' ''Tamakokko'') is a {{i|Neutral}} [[Elements|element]] [[Pals|Pal]].

== Paldeck Entry==
{{Paldeck|Extremely weak and far too delicious. It is one of the weakest Pals alongside [[Lamball]]. No matter how many are hunted, they just keep appearing.}}
==Biology==
===Appearance===
Chikipi is a pal resembling a white chicken. Its body is vaguely egg-shaped and it has grey oval eyes. The beak of Chikipi is yellow and features a red wattle. The feet of Chikipi are orange with two clawed toes in the front and one toe at the back of the foot. The top of a Chikipi's head has a large comb that is red just like its waddle.

===Behavior===
Wild Chikipi may sporadically lay eggs on the ground, which can be picked up by the player. This Pal retaliates only when attacked, though neighboring Chikipi will become aggressive upon witnessing another Chikipi being harmed by the player.

==Update History==
*[[Early Access 0.1.2.0]]
**Introduced.

==Trivia== 
*It was previously called '''Chickegg'''.
*Chikipi's name may come from “chicken”, “chick”, and “chickpea” due to this Pal's small size.
*Its Japanese name may come from 卵 ''tamago'' (egg) or simply 玉 ''tama'' (sphere/ball), and コッコ ''kokko'' (onomatopoeia for the sound a chicken makes).
*Chikipi has:
**The lowest stat total of all Pals, at 180.
**The lowest HP of all Pals at 60, tied with [[Fuack]], [[Sparkit]], [[Killamari|Killamari,]] [[Tocotoco]], [[Swee]], and [[Flambelle]].
*Chikipi was featured in Paldeck No.031 on PocketPair [https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1707726930106331431 X] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJWqlcX855k youtube channel].
