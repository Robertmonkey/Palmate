Breeding overview â€” palworld.fandom.com (rendered HTML)
To breed Pals together you will need a Breeding Farm. Once you place the Breeding Farm you must assign a male and female Pal. The Breeding Farm also needs to be supplied with Cake. After some time they will produce a Pal Egg which can then be incubated.
Breeding eggs now have a slight chance to produce an Alpha Pal.
